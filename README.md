# Heart Arrhythmia Modelling with Invertible Neural-Networks
This repository contains the code for my master thesis "Heart Arrhythmia Modelling with Invertible Neural Networks" (Ruprecht Karl University of Heidelberg, Institute for Computer Science, Visual Learning Lab). It includes the code used for data generation, model creation as well as training and testing the models.
The code for the forward model is provided on https://github.com/mathemedical/HEAT_forwardSim and is required for both "datagen.py" and "training.py" of the code on this repository.
