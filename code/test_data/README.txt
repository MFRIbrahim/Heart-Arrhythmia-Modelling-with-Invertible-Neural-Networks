test data files contain lists:

[conditional variable with n_Rwaves-1 many RR-intervals, the full RR-interval list, n_Rwaves, atrial_cycle_length, conduction_constant, the block pattern that was used to generate the RR-interval list, block_type]

These were created with the "get_random_y" function from the "datagen.py" file.
